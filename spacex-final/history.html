        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan
            of
            entering service in 2009. Also in 2006, SpaceX won a contract to use the Dragon spacecraft for commercially
            supplied resupply services to the International Space Station for the American federal space agency, NASA.
        </p>
        <p>
            During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated
            spacecraft to
            be recovered successfully from orbit. On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial
            spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX is
            contracted to deliver cargo to the ISS under NASA's Commercial Resupply Servicesprogram, and Dragon began
            regular cargo flights in October 2012. With the Dragon spacecraft and the Orbital ATK Cygnus, NASA seeks to
            increase its partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.

            On 3 June 2017, the CRS-11 capsule largely assembled from previously flown components from the CRS-4 mission
            in
            September 2014 was launched again for the first time, with the hull, structural elements, thrusters,
            harnesses,
            propellant tanks, plumbing and many of the avionics reused while the heat shield, batteries and components
            exposed to sea water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.
