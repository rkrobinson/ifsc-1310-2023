  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibilty</h2>
  <p><strong>Derek Featherstone</strong> lecture over Web accessibility just made me realize how important it is to have access to the web despite your situation. I worked in a long term care facility and I got the opportunity to to witness first hand on this topic. 
    I watched residents that were quadriplegic who were stuck in the bed and despite that use the internet due to different software and hardware. 
    One was scrolling his ipad and moving it with just his eyes and before that he had a mouse that he used his chin to operate on what he wanted to click. 
    The other one used a tube that he blew in to help operate his laptown. 
    Now prior to this I never even considered how someone in this situation could use the internet which was unfair because no their bodies didnâ€™t work like mine but they still deserved to get the chance to use something that is apart of all our lives

  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>The "Understanding Progressive Enhancement" article, from A List Apart sheds light on the evolution of web development practices the transition from degradation to progressive enhancement. Throughout the mid 1990s web development primarily focused on degradation, which prioritized browsers with advanced features and often overlooked users relying on older browsers such as Netscape 4. Although this approach was functional it didn't align with Tim Berners Lees vision of creating an accessible web. In 2003 Steve Champeon and Nick Finck introduced enhancement, which brought about a paradigm shift in web development. This approach emphasizes building web experiences with a foundation, in content to ensure that all users can access the core content and functionality of websites regardless of their browser or device capabilities. By doing progressive enhancement enhances the web experience while maintaining universal accessibility and staying true to the original ethos of the World Wide Web.

  <h2>Reflection Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This final project was challenging for me because this caused for me to step outside my comfort zone and trust the process. I showed a few of my friends and colleagues how the website look and some of my shortcomings and they were impressed. Which was hard for me to figure out what I need to do in order to improve my skills and my website. Now my colleagues were a bit more honest and helpful about how my website should at least look and operate. In the beginning I did have a night sky filled with stars and they were honest about how I should change it and have it a bit more realistic and clear for the readability of the website. The small things I did with the hovering and other things were cool and a nice touch but I realized that stuff like that should be on the backend and the purpose of the website should come first. 

    The Web Tech course itself was a load of information. I absolutely appreciated how the instructor Thomas Wallace gave us the comparison of "Driving water through a fire hose" because that's what it was like. But he made sure we had enough resources to accomplish any task set before us. Before the class I some prior knowledge of some web development stuff but he really made frontend development understandable and actually enjoyable for someone like myself who likes the backend better. One of the biggest lessons I've learned was make sure your file directory is set up correctly because if not towards the end it's a huge hassle to undo and get the files nested properly. The instructor was patient and fair and held us all accountable for our work.  Honestly my classmates and myself were actually set up for success from the beginning and those labs every Friday were a big key! The individual who helped on every Friday was very knowledgeable and super patient with us students. This course has really made me humble myself and take a step back and reevaluate my approach to this field and decide what I want my career trajectory to be. Things I would do differently would be to write down what I learned and had difficulty understanding.  I'd organize my coursework efficiently and clearly. So my background with my space x page was a sky full of stars and I had to change it because despite it looking pretty good it wasn't very readable.
