  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibilty</h2>
  <p><strong>Derek Featherstone</strong> lecture over Web accessibility just made me realize how important it is to have access to the web despite your situation. I worked in a long term care facility and I got the opportunity to to witness first hand on this topic. 
    I watched residents that were quadriplegic who were stuck in the bed and despite that use the internet due to different software and hardware. 
    One was scrolling his ipad and moving it with just his eyes and before that he had a mouse that he used his chin to operate on what he wanted to click. 
    The other one used a tube that he blew in to help operate his laptown. 
    Now prior to this I never even considered how someone in this situation could use the internet which was unfair because no their bodies didnâ€™t work like mine but they still deserved to get the chance to use something that is apart of all our lives

  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>The "Understanding Progressive Enhancement" article, from A List Apart sheds light on the evolution of web development practices the transition from degradation to progressive enhancement. Throughout the mid 1990s web development primarily focused on degradation, which prioritized browsers with advanced features and often overlooked users relying on older browsers such as Netscape 4. Although this approach was functional it didn't align with Tim Berners Lees vision of creating an accessible web. In 2003 Steve Champeon and Nick Finck introduced enhancement, which brought about a paradigm shift in web development. This approach emphasizes building web experiences with a foundation, in content to ensure that all users can access the core content and functionality of websites regardless of their browser or device capabilities. By doing progressive enhancement enhances the web experience while maintaining universal accessibility and staying true to the original ethos of the World Wide Web.
